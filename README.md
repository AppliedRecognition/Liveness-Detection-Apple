# Liveness Detection

The LivenessDetection framework detects whether an image or its part were taken live or off a screen or a photograph.

The framework has two detectors:

- **Moire detector**<br />Finds moire pattern interference artifacts
- **Spoof device detector**<br />Finds devices that can be used to spoof liveness, e.g., screens, photographs
